# Hi there 👋🏽

I'm Anuj Bhatia. I love learning about people, history, and new ideas. My goal in life is to improve the human experience.

Currently I live in the SF Bay Area with my wife and daughter. And work as a Principal Architect at Microsoft on our AI Platform and Services, and previously worked on Xamarin with a bunch of awesome folks. 

For the last 10 years I've been working to enable developers to build products that make life better for the world. Right now, I'm interested in exploring the idea of ["leverage"](https://www.navalmanack.com/blog-posts/biggest-lessons). And more specifically, how we can use technology to empower people to accomplish their goals.

In my spare time, I'm cooking and playing on the floor and reading books with my family.
